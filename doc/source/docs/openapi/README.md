# OpenAPI

Conduit applications auto-generate an OpenAPI 3.0 document.

Most of your OpenAPI document is generated by reflecting on your application code, especially `ResourceController` subclasses. You add customization or additional information by overriding methods in `APIComponentDocumenter` and `APIOperationDocumenter`. At minimum, you override methods in your `ResourceController` to document the responses your application will send for a particular endpoint.

You create documents with the `conduit document` command-line tool.
